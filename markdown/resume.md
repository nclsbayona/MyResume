Experience
----------

**Volunteer Work Experience:**

_**Academic mentor at Pontifical Xaverian University**_:

  - As an academic mentor at the university I was in charge of:
    
    - Welcoming new coming students to a new stage in their lives.
    - Helping the new coming students in their adaptation process.
    - Tell students about my experience as an student so far, my greatest challenges and important lessons I learnt throughout my life.
    - Act as a leader to new coming students, so that they felt they were accompanied in their adaptation processes.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Most of my technical work is in my GitHub profile, you can visit my profile at [https://github.com/nclsbayona](https://github.com/nclsbayona)

**My Cool Side Projects:**\
Usually I practice my skills via some helpful project that I tend to mantain over time, I think it's really good to automate repetitive tasks and jobs a bot or some type of automation software can do on its own. Examples of this are my

**Programming Languages:**   
Throughout my life, I've worked in many projects and therefore, I've adquired a lot of experience 

* **_C++:_** \
The first programming language I learnt was C++, the most valuable thing I think I learnt from my C++ learning was programming logic. I think that C++ is a really great language because it acts as a basis for other languages and many tools that have been working flawlessly since it first appeared almost 40 years ago.
  * _Advantages:_
    - C++ is really efficient in terms of memory consumption, execution time, and comparatively in energy consumption thanks to being a compiled language.
    - C++ allows the use of not only classes but c-like structs too, which gives the language a lot of possibilities and extensibility too.
  
  * _Disadvantages:_
    - C++ is a complex language, not only because of its syntax but also because of other stuff like pointers and security, and therefore, it requires a lot of time to implement algorithms in C++.
    - Due to C++ being a compiled language, executables are strictly attached to an specific architecture, an executable file might present problems when trying to execute the program in an architecture different from the one it was compiled in the first place.
    - There exist libraries that don't offer cross-platform versions, and that might not work in an environment different from the one it was developed in first place, this allows programs to work only in a specific machine.
  


* **_Python:_** \
Description of your experience with second-lang, perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source file). 

* **_Java:_** \
We both know this one's pushing it. 

* **_Other relevant information:_** \
Also, I have basic knowledge of other programming languages like _**TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **C**, **Dart** and **Swift**_, as well as markup languages such as _**YAML**, **HTML**, **XML** and **JSON**_, and other tech-related tools like _**Kubernetes - Kubectl**, **Docker - Podman**, **Github Actions** and **AWS**_.
