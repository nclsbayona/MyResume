Experience

**Volunteer Work Experience:**

_**Academic mentor at Pontifical Xaverian University**_:

  As an academic mentor at the university I was in charge of:
    
    - Welcoming new coming students to a new stage in their lives.
    - Helping the new coming students in their adaptation process.
    - Tell students about my experience as an student so far, my greatest challenges and important lessons I learnt throughout my life.
    - Act as a leader to new coming students, so that they felt they were accompanied in their adaptation processes.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Most of my technical work is in my GitHub profile, you can visit my profile at [https://github.com/nclsbayona](https://github.com/nclsbayona)

My Cool Side Project:\
  For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
  list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source:\
    List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages:   
**C++:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

**second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

**obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

Basic knowledge of **Go**, **JavaScript**, **C**, ****
